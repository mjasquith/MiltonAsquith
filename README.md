## Background
In my 20 year career spanning various sectors in the IT industry, I have continually evolved my expertise to meet the dynamic demands of the industry. My journey has encompassed diverse roles including Business Analysis, Software Development, Application Support, and Quality Assurance. I have found Quality Assurance the best fit for my skills and mindset and have been learning & growing in this role since 2015. My previous experience has afforded me an unusually broad perspective making me as a better tester, helping me do the "glue" work within/across teams, and ensuring the focus is on improving confidence in, and quality of, the software delivered.

In my most recent roles at Apadmi and Magellan Robotech I have lead test automation projects and implemented UI and API test automation frameworks from scratch for web & mobile native applications and back-end services. This has involved using a range of tools and technologies (e.g. python, java, javascript, selenium, appium, Postman/Newman, RESTAssured, and SoapUI) proving my adaptability, capacity to learn, and growth mindset.

My commitment to excellence is underscored by my exceptional verbal and written communication skills. I possess a proven ability to adapt my language to cater to the technical proficiency levels of diverse stakeholders, ensuring effective collaboration and knowledge dissemination across teams and stakeholders.
